            <p>Hello, my name is Travonne Wilson and this page wiki will discuss my 3 favotite hobbies. There are many things I enjoy doing, but these take up most of my time. I hope you enjoy.
            </p>

            <h2>Watching Movies</h2>
            <p>Watching movies is my number 1 favorite hobby, I usually prefer horror movies, but scifi has caught my attention as well.</p>

            <p>My second most hobby would be working out. Having a healthy body is very important to me.</p>
            <p>Due to a back injury I am not able to workout as much as I used to but luckily working out is more than just pressing heavy weights, yoga and meditation are great ways to work out as well.</p>
            
            <article>
            <p> Luckily <a href="https://www.lafitness.com/Pages/Default.aspx">LA Fitness</a> has a large variety of classes and equipment for all.
            </p>
            <p> If youre in the downtown area the <a href="https://beltline.org/">Beltline</a> has a great walking/biking/running trail with an outside gym.</p>

            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>Not only is it important to have a healthy body you must also have a healthy mind, so another hobby that I enjoy is reading books. I have also been into reading as a kid, but throw my teenage years that declined.</p>
            <p>As an adult I remembered the importance of reading and how it makes a positive impact on my mind and life and picked up this hobby once again.</p>
            <p>These are probably my favorite and/or most beneficial books that I've read so favorite
                <ul>
                    <li>Outliers</li>
                    <li>Its Your Ship</li>
                    <li>Rich Dad Poor Dad</li>
                </ul>
